## Introductions

In our current workflow, data updates are managed weekly by the Data Team, utilizing a spreadsheet and Slack channel for distribution. This decentralized process places a heavy reliance on the Data Team's workload, hindering efficiency and timely decision-making. Addressing this challenge is crucial to expedite our business decisions. Thus, the question arises: How can we streamline routine tasks to enhance efficiency and accessibility for stakeholders? It's worth noting that the need for user maintenance data is crucially required by the User Relations Team, intensifying the urgency for a solution. The answer lies in implementing a Self-Service Analytics (SSA) platform. SSA offers an autonomous solution, enabling users to independently gather and analyze data, thereby facilitating quicker decision-making processes.


## What Tools To Use

- Looker Studio / Google Data Studio
- MySQL
- DBeaver
- Google Sheet / Spreadsheet


## Preparations

Here, I want to describe a few tools in this analysis:

- Connect the data from MySQL to Looker Studio with Custom Query

- Tools/Functions we use:
  - Filtering
  - Tabular Data
  - Data Viz
  - Embed Report
  - etc
  

## Dashboard Visualizations
The dashboard consists of five unique pages, each with a specific name and function to enhance data understanding and decision-making.

### Guideline Page: 
This page serves as a general guide for using the dashboard, providing instructions and tips for navigation, as well as further understanding of the presented data. We can see it as a preview in ***Fig. 1*** below.
