Te Kahu, Wanaka, New Zealand\nAirbnb is an online marketplace that connects people who want to rent out their homes with people looking for accommodations in specific locales. The company has come a long way since 2007, when its co-founders first came up with the idea to invite paying guests to sleep on an air mattress in their living room. According to Airbnb’s latest data, it now has more than 7 million listings, covering some 100,000 cities and towns in 220-plus countries and regions worldwide.\nExploratory Data Analytics\nPreparation\nGoogle Colaboratory\nImport Libraries Python: pandas, numpy, matplotlib\nThis public dataset is part of Airbnb, This is New York City Airbnb Open Data from Dgomonov.\nConnect with the data\nConnect the data\nThe first step is that we have to make sure our data is connected.\n\n# Connect with dataset in drive\nfrom google.colab import drive\ndrive.mount(\"/content/drive\")\n\nImport and Reading Data\nImport libraries\nImport libraries we need to use, like:\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport random as random\nimport random\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport warnings\n\nRead the data\nRead the data\n\n# Read the data\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"/content/drive/MyDrive/dataset nyc airbnb/AB_NYC_2019.csv\")\n\nData Understandings\nBasic data understandings\nThis is basic data understandings like:\nDataFrame : df.\nshape : df.shape()\nhead : df.head()\ninfo : df.info()\ndescribe : df.describe()\nData Processing\nInformations of Dataset\nIn the first step of data processing we can use several database understandings to see an overview of the dataset to data type information and check for the duplicates values.\n\ndf.head() #

The value of correlation can take any value from -1 to 1. Correlation between two random variables or bivariate data does not necessarily imply a causal relationship. We can see it as in Fig. 2 below 👇\nFig. 2. Heatmaps Correlations.Count of Room Types by Neighbourhood Group\nTo create an analysis of this, we first collected data from Airbnb listings and created Airbnb areas based on neighborhood groups such as: Manhattan, Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island. We then calculated three main room types: Whole house/apartment, Shared room, and Private room in each neighborhood group. We can see the details in Fig. 3.\nFig. 3. Count of Room Types by Neighbourhood GroupThe results indicate that Manhattan has the highest number of Entire home/apt listings, reflecting its popularity as a tourist destination. Brooklyn follows closely behind, offering a mix of room types. In contrast, the Bronx, Queens, and Staten Island have a higher proportion of Entire home/apt and Private rooms, likely due to their residential nature.\nProportion of Airbnb listings across boroughs and room_type\nThis is Breakdown from Count of Room Types by Neighbourhood Group\nProportion of Airbnb listings across boroughs\nIn this analysis, we explore the distribution of Airbnb listings across the five major boroughs of New York City: Manhattan, Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island. We can see details in Fig. 4.\nFig. 4. Proportion of Airbnb Listings Across Boroughs.Regarding boroughs in this graph Fig. 4., Manhattan and Brooklyn have the highest proportions of Airbnb listings, reflecting their status as top tourist destinations. Queens also boasts a significant number of listings, while the Bronx offers a more affordable alternative. Staten Island, with its suburban appeal, has the smallest share of Airbnb listings among the five boroughs.\nProportion of Airbnb listings across room_type\nIn addition to region, We explored the Airbnb listing distribution of three room types in New York City: Entire home/apt, Private room, and Shared room. We can see details in Fig. 5.\nFig. 5. Proportions of Airbnb Listings Across Room Type.In terms of room types, Airbnb listings in New York City predominantly comprise “Entire home/apt” options, catering to those seeking privacy and convenience. “Private room” listings come next, offering a balance between affordability and comfort. “Shared room” listings are the least common, serving budget-conscious solo travelers or those comfortable sharing living spaces.\nWhere The Most Expensive Area?\nTo analyze the data, we first gathered information on rental prices for these room types in each borough. Afterward, we calculated the average rental price for each combination of borough and room type. Here are the findings:\nManhattan: Unsurprisingly, Manhattan emerges as the most expensive borough overall, with entire homes/apartments being the costliest, followed by private rooms and shared rooms.\nBronx: In the Bronx, shared rooms are the most affordable option, followed by private rooms and entire homes/apartments.\nBrooklyn: Brooklyn exhibits a similar pattern to Manhattan, with entire homes/apartments being the most expensive, followed by private rooms and shared rooms.\nQueens: Queens generally offers more affordable accommodations compared to Manhattan and Brooklyn. Entire homes/apartments are the priciest, followed by private rooms and shared rooms.\nStaten Island: Staten Island, being the least expensive of the five boroughs, sees private rooms as the most economical choice, followed by shared rooms and entire homes/apartments.\nTo visualize these findings, we’ve created bar graphs below that represent the average rental prices for each borough and room type. These graphs will help you better understand the price distribution across the different areas and accommodation types. We can see details in Fig. 6.\nFig. 6. The Most Expensive Area.Please note that the specific rental prices can vary greatly within each borough, and this analysis provides a general overview. If you have access to the relevant data, you can create more detailed analyses and visuals to dive deeper into the specific neighborhoods and factors influencing rental prices in each area.\nMost Popular Neighbourhood Group Based On Availability?\nThe box plot analysis depicts the availability of Airbnb listings in the five major boroughs of New York City (Manhattan, Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island). The ‘availability_365’ metric is used to measure the availability of listings throughout the year. We can see the details in Fig. 7.\nFig. 7. The Most Popular Area Based On Availability.Looking at the above categorical box plot we can infer that the listings in State Island seems to be more available throughout the year to more than 300 days. On an average, these listings are available to around more 250 days every year followed by Bronx where every listings are available for around more 150 on an average every year.\nLet’s also see Map Box Distributions\nFig. 8. Map Box Distributions.Mapbox distribution in New York City shows varying levels of usage across the five boroughs: Manhattan, Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island. In Manhattan, where the bustling heart of the city resides, Mapbox is likely to see high utilization, with its mapping and location services catering to the demands of businesses, tourists, and residents alike.\nTop 5 Host Listing\nTo find Top 5 hosts by total listings count.\nFig. 9. Top 5 Host Listings.As we can find that Top 5 host name are Sonder (NYC), Blueground, Kara, Kazuya, and Sonder.\nConclusion\nThe results indicate that Manhattan has the highest number of Entire home/apt listings, reflecting its popularity as a tourist destination. Brooklyn follows closely behind, offering a mix of room types. In contrast, the Bronx, Queens, and Staten Island have a higher proportion of Entire home/apt and Private rooms, likely due to their residential nature.\nWe can infer that there are high range of prices across Manhattan followed by Brooklyn and Queens being the most costliest place to stay in NYC.\nUnderstanding these proportions can assist travelers in selecting accommodations that suit their preferences and budgets.\nObservations\nManhattan has the highest number of Entire home/apt listings, reflecting its popularity as a tourist destination. Brooklyn follows closely behind, offering a mix of room types. Then Manhattan have more expensive places to stay in NYC. Room availability is very low in manhattan and brooklyn and you can find a room anytime in the State Island and Bronx.\nRecomendations\nIf you are looking for the most expensive locations you can come to Manhattan and Brooklyn or Queens. However, if you want to find the places with the highest availability in New York City, you can choose a location like the Bronx with an average of more than 150 days every year or State Island with an average of more than 250 days available every year.\n\nTHANK YOU 🙌\n\n\n\n\n",

representation of a correlation matrix representing the correlation between different variables. The value of correlation can take any value from -1 to 1. Correlation between two random variables or bivariate data does not necessarily imply a causal relationship. We can see it as in Fig. 3 below 👇\nFig. 3. Heatmaps Correlations.Very Active Minutes by Day of the Week\nText\nFig. 4.

This is to observe the performance patterns of the interns.\nWhat Tools To Use\nSpreadsheets\nSCQA Framework\nHere’s the SCQA Frameworks we use:\nSituation:\nThere is a working hour regulation for interns, which is currently set at 40 hours per week.\nThere is a discussion about changing the working hour regulation with two options: 30 hours per week or 15 hours per week.\nThe Campaign has implemented a work deliverables sheet in the commitment form, which serves as evidence of data regarding the tasks and working hours of interns every day.\nComplication:\nThe implementation of work deliverables has not been optimal due to the difficulty in monitoring, both by mentors and the people team.\nFeedback from some interns indicates that it is not very effective due to excessive administrative work, such as the obligation to fill out standup.ly and Jira tasks.\nAs a result, data related to the average working hours of interns per week cannot be compiled.\nQuestion:\nHow can we monitor and track the working hours of interns along with the tasks/projects they are working on?\nAnswer:\nTime/Task/Project Sheet Tracker\nModify the existing work deliverables sheet to create a sheet/form that is visually easier for interns to fill out.\nMentors can more easily monitor and provide feedback on a weekly/monthly basis.\nWorking hour data can be pulled by the people team, ensuring that interns comply with their choice of working hours (30 or 15 hours per week).\nPreparations\nHere, I want to describe a few tools in this analysis:\nSpreadsheets\nTools/Functions we use:\nFiltering\nSlicer\nImportrange\nFormating\nIF Functions\netc\n\nFiles : I want to know you Data files are hidden due to company secrets.\nStep and Plan\nCreate Template Work Deliverables Sheet\nCreate a new template with modifications from the previous sheet. This template will later be duplicated by each intern, then the data in the work deliverables sheet will be pulled into the Time Sheet Tracker (people-team data center). Heres the picture Work Deliverables Sheet Template.\n\nFig. 1. Template Work Deliverables Sheet.\nTimeSheet Monitoring Tracker\nCreate a TimeSheet Monitoring Tracker (Central Data). In the time sheet tracker there will be 4 sections:\nGuidlines: Contains How to Use the TimeSheet Monitoring Tracker\n\nFig. 2. Guidlines Tracker\nPeople Team Monitoring: Contains a total recap of internal work deliverables such as total working hours per week per intern.\n\nFig. 3. People Team Monitoring Tracker\nMentor Monitoring: Recap of internal work deliverables per team, to make it easier for mentors to check without having to open internal deliverables one by one.\n\nFig. 4. Mentor Monitoring Tracker\nData-Viz: To see a graph of the development of internal working hours.\n\nFig. 5. Data Vizualization Monitoring Tracker\nTrial and Error\nAfter the work deliverables sheets and TimeSheet Monitoring Tracker are created, we carry out the next step, namely by Trial & Error to finding out of the best way to reach a desired result or a correct solution by trying out one or more ways or means and by noting and eliminating errors or causes of failure.\nEvaluations\nEvaluation needs to be carried out to assess or calculate the quality of the TimeSheet Monitoring Tracker that we have developed. We can do this with all the data that has been collected since TimeSheet Monitoring Tracker was used.\nFinalization\nIn the last step we finalize it after all the steps have been carried out and the TimeSheet Monitoring Tracker can be used properly.\n\n\n\n",
