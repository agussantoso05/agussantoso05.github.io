      "contents": "\nIntroductions\nIn our current workflow, data updates are managed weekly by the Data Team, utilizing a spreadsheet and Slack channel for distribution. This decentralized process places a heavy reliance on the Data Team‚Äôs workload, hindering efficiency and timely decision-making. Addressing this challenge is crucial to expedite our business decisions. Thus, the question arises: How can we streamline routine tasks to enhance efficiency and accessibility for stakeholders? It‚Äôs worth noting that the need for user maintenance data is crucially required by the User Relations Team, intensifying the urgency for a solution. The answer lies in implementing a Self-Service Analytics (SSA) platform. SSA offers an autonomous solution, enabling users to independently gather and analyze data, thereby facilitating quicker decision-making processes.\nWhat Tools To Use\nLooker Studio / Google Data Studio\nMySQL\nDBeaver\nGoogle Sheet / Spreadsheet\nPreparations\nHere, I want to describe a few tools in this analysis:\nConnect the data from MySQL to Looker Studio with Custom Query\nTools/Functions we use:\nFiltering\nTabular Data\nData Viz\nEmbed Report\netc\n\nDashboard Visualizations\nThe dashboard consists of five unique pages, each with a specific name and function to enhance data understanding and decision-making.\nGuideline Page:\nThis page serves as a general guide for using the dashboard, providing instructions and tips for navigation, as well as further understanding of the presented data. We can see it as a preview in Fig. 1 below.\nFig. 1. Guideline.Realtime - Summary Viz:\nThis page presents brief visualizations of real-time data related to user activities and drilling, allowing stakeholders to quickly grasp the big picture. We can see it as a preview in Fig. 2 below.\nFig. 2. Realtime - Summary Visualization.Realtime - Tabular Data User:\nOn this page, real-time tabular data related to users is presented, enabling stakeholders to directly examine detailed data. We can see it as a preview in Fig. 3 below.\nFig. 3. Realtime - Tabular Data User.Detail - Profile User\nThis page displays detailed profiles of users, including their history, preferences, and performance, providing deeper insights into specific users. We can see it as a preview in Fig. 4 below.\nFig. 4. Detail - Profile User.Glossary:\nThis page serves as a reference for stakeholders to understand the terms and concepts used in the dashboard. We can see it as a preview in Fig. 5 below.\nFig. 5.
